Network Socket Specifications:
  The program will utilize json packets in order to send and receive information in a concise manner.
  A packet will have the two following parts:
    - a 2 byte length, specifying the length of the following JSON packet. This is done to ensure that the entire packet is read.
    - a JSON packet. It has the following three fields:
      - 'msg' - The incoming message if there is one. Used to communicate in certain points that will be described in the chat protocol.
      - 'nick' - The nickname of the person who sent the message. Set to None upon connection, and will change upon approval. server has reserved nickname SERVER
      - 'proto' - The protocol that will be followed. Used to communicate where each connection is sending its messaage. The accepted protocols will be described below.
        - verify - This protocol is used by the client to tell the server that it is in the verification step of submitting it's nickname.
          The msg at this stage is the nickname that the client would like to use. 
        - broadcast - This protocol is used by the client to tell the server that it would like to broadcast it's msg field to every other connected client.
          The server will then send the exact same packet to every other connected client. If a client receives broadcast as a proto, it will simply print the nick and msg fields.
        - goodbye - This protocol is used by the client to tell the server that it is about to disconnect. The server will then handle resource cleanup 
          (nickname removal, removal from socket lists) and close the socket. 
        - shutdown - This protocol is used by the server to tell connected clients that it is about to shut down. The msg field will 
          contain a message saying how long until shutdown each client has.
