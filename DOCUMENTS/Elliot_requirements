Application Inputs and Outputs:
  Client program user inputs:
    - Client program should be able to get input through the curses module.
      - Provided the curses module works as intended, There will be an area where
        the user will be able to type any inputs into a text box. The user can escape this using 
        escape. The user could then bring up a user list or a manual. Direct messages could be interesting.
      - Commands can be executed through the syntax /command (This will cause certain combinations to be untypable on their own) 
        or through key combination (ctrl-C)
    - Client program outputs to the user:
      - The client program will output a user interface by use of the curses module
      - There will be a space for user input at the bottom of the screen 
      - Above space for messages to be typed, there will be space for messages from other users
        to be displayed
      
    - Server program user inputs:
      - Provided we do decided to make it a moderator type thing
      - there will be a command to print user nicknames
      - command to disconnect users
    - Server program outputs to user:
      - The server should output whenever there is a connect or disconnect
      - The server maybe should print that it is broadcasting a message
